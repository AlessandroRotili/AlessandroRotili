### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub repository! My name is Alessandro Rotili, a 29-year-old sports enthusiast with a passion for software development. Prior to pursuing programming, I worked as a personal trainer.

I have worked with several programming languages, including .NET and Angular, and am currently focusing on Java. I also have experience with Python and MQL4, and am always looking for new challenges and learning opportunities.

Aside from programming, I am also an avid music fan with a particular love for hard rock and metal. In my free time, I enjoy playing the electric guitar.

I am always open to making new connections and collaborations, as my mind is constantly seeking new knowledge to learn. Within this repository, you will find some of my recent projects, including code examples and personal projects. I hope they prove useful and interesting to the developer community. Please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions or comments. Thank you for visiting my repository!
